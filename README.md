Used technologies: html,javascript,css,jquery.
Development process: first,i've started by creating the grid where the markers will be in.next,i've used jqeury to insert the markers inside the grid.after that i started styling the game.finally, i tried to determine the winner. 
Challenges: the hardest part was determining the winner.
the most entertianing part was styling the game and inserting the markers inside the grid.
I've used functions like addClass(),removeClass() to indicate which players turn is it.
